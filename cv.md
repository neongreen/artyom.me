## About me

I'm a self-taught Haskeller with 1 year of professional experience (and 6 years overall). In the past I successfully participated in IOI and ACM-style programming competitions; if needed, I'd be able to refresh my knowledge of algorithms pretty quickly. Also, I enjoy writing tutorials (and documenting things in general).

I speak Russian and English.

## Potential dealbreakers

  * I have dropped out of university
  * I've only been employed once, and unofficially
  * besides Haskell, I don't have much experience with other languages

## Haskell

I've been studying and using Haskell for 6 years. I have experience with:

  * **Lenses:** wrote a [series of articles](https://artyom.me/#lens-over-tea) explaining in detail how [lens](@hackage) is implemented and the theory behind it; my most used library is [microlens](@hackage), a minimal lens library compatible with lens.

  * **Server-side programming:** for a client, I wrote a backend for a static website hosting (with [Snap](http://snapframework.com/) and Sqlite), a CLI tool for interacting with it, and parts of the server and [Liquid markup](http://liquidmarkup.org/) parser/renderer.

  * **Parsing:** for the same client, I designed a small [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)-like language and wrote a parser and an intepreter for it.

  * **Template Haskell:** rewrote a big TH module for my yet-unreleased Aeson fork; know enough to implement a [version of `makeLenses` from lens](https://artyom.me/lens-over-tea-6#the-answer-4).

  * **GUI:** have written several utilities using GTK.

  * **FFI:** have written [code for simulating keypresses on Linux](https://github.com/aelve/fake-type/blob/master/lib/FakeType.hs).

  * **Interfacing with REST APIs:** have written a [bot for Telegram](@gh:neongreen/untilbot) together with a binding for Telegram API.

I have several yet-unreleased projects; the ones that I'm working on right now are a [site for collaborative notes on Haskell libraries](@gh:aelve/guide), an [Aeson fork with more features and better usability](@gh:aelve/json-x), and a [minimalistic reminding tool](@gh:aelve/tom).

Additionally, I have written perhaps the most popular [Aeson tutorial](https://artyom.me/aeson), and once I designed a [Haskell task](https://artyom.me/haskell-ctf) for a hacker competition.

## Everything else

Several years ago I've been actively participating in IOI/ACM-style programming competitions:

  * Belarusian National Olympiad (2012): 15th place, silver
  * All-Russian Team Olympiad (2011): 10th place, bronze
  * Moscow Open Olympiad in Programming (2012): silver

I have basic knowledge of SQL, and Sqlite in particular (where “basic knowledge” means “enough to write a backend for a static website hosting”). I also know some C, Pascal, and [Nim][].
