## About me

I'm a self-taught Haskeller with one year of professional experience (6 years overall). In the past I successfully participated in ACM-style programming competitions; if needed, I'd be able to refresh my knowledge of algorithms quickly.

I enjoy writing tutorials and documenting things, and I care about usability more than I care about principles.

I'm not one of those people who seem okay at the interview but then start making crude jokes in Slack and saying “okay mr boss whatever I'll do it if you want :)) but FYI I still think it's stupid :)))))” when you ask them to do something.

I speak Russian and English.

## Potential dealbreakers

  * I have dropped out of university.
  * I have a job right now so I'll only be available for any offers from September 2017 (but hey, if your offer is awesome I'll consider leaving earlier).
  * Besides Haskell, I don't have much experience with other languages.

## Haskell

I've been studying and using Haskell for 6 years. I have experience with:

  * **Lenses:** wrote a [series of articles](https://artyom.me/#lens-over-tea) explaining in detail how lens is implemented and the theory behind it; my most used library is [microlens](@hackage), a minimal lens library compatible with lens.

  * **Server-side programming:** for a client, I wrote a backend for a static website hosting (with Snap and Sqlite), a CLI tool for interacting with it, and parts of the server and Liquid markup parser/renderer.

  * **Parsing:** for the same client, I designed a small JSONPath-like language for extracting data from JSON and MessagePack files and wrote a parser and an intepreter for it.

  * **Template Haskell:** rewrote a big TH module for my yet-unreleased Aeson fork; know enough to [implement a version](https://artyom.me/lens-over-tea-6#the-answer-4) of `makeLenses` from lens.

  * **GUI:** have written several utilities using GTK.

  * **FFI:** have written [code](https://github.com/aelve/fake-type/blob/master/lib/FakeType.hs) for simulating keypresses on Linux.

  * **Interfacing with REST APIs:** have written a [bot for Telegram](@gh:neongreen/untilbot) together with a binding for Telegram API.

I have several yet-unreleased projects; the one that I'm working on right now is a [site for collaborative notes on Haskell libraries](@gh:aelve/guide).

Additionally, I have written perhaps the most popular [Aeson tutorial](https://artyom.me/aeson), and once I designed a [Haskell task](https://artyom.me/haskell-ctf) for a hacker competition.

## Everything else

Several years ago I've been actively participating in IOI/ACM-style programming competitions:

  * Belarusian National Olympiad (2012): 15th place, silver
  * All-Russian Team Olympiad (2011): 10th place, bronze
  * Moscow Open Olympiad in Programming (2012): silver

I have basic knowledge of SQL, and Sqlite in particular (where “basic knowledge” means “enough to write a backend for a static website hosting”). I also know some C, Pascal, and [Nim][].
