## tl;dr

I'm a Haskeller with eight years of experience (working for three years). I
have spent substantial time dealing with REST APIs (client and server),
parsing, serialization, FFI, GUIs, and implementing protocols. I have
delivered talks about lenses, Template Haskell, and type-level programming.

I used to be a cryptocurrency developer; nowadays I'm a backend engineer for
an end-to-end-encrypted messenger. I have several side projects, including a
book about Haskell and a software consultancy.

I have enough background knowledge about various tricky topics (Unicode,
algorithms and data structures, cryptography) that I can often prevent
people from doing silly things with them.

Potential dealbreaker: I don't have higher education.

## Where I work

Right now I work at [Wire][]. Our [backend][wire-server] is fully
open-source and written in Haskell. I'm busy implementing enhancements,
writing specs, and doing prototyping for novel features. I'm also doing some
devops work (Cassandra, AWS, Ansible, Kubernetes), but there I wouldn't
survive for long without my teammates' expertise.

Our protocol libraries are written in Rust and I contribute to them. Some of
the aforementioned novel features also involve writing Rust libraries. I'd
say that I'm an advanced Rust beginner – comfortable with the core language,
but without experience in tricky topics like concurrency.

Previously I worked at [Serokell][], where I was one of core developers of
[Cardano][], a hugely successful cryptocurrency with dozens of devs on the
team. Other than writing a substantial part of the code and doing
bug-hunting, I was involved in many architectural and design decisions.

I am also a co-founder of [Monadfix][], a Haskell-and-Agda software
consultancy. I manage the business and research clients' problems.

## Open-source and community

I'm writing [Intermediate Haskell][IH] – a book about
intermediate-to-advanced Haskell topics. I also maintain several Haskell
libraries; the two bigger ones are [fmt](@hackage) and
[microlens](@hackage).

[IH]: https://intermediatehaskell.com

In addition to that, I have two non-trivial side-projects:

  * [Codesearch][] – a search engine for code, supporting regular
    expressions. I have not contributed to the code but I hired developers
    and currently I serve as a CTO and product manager.

  * [Guide][] – a wiki engine and a Haskell documentation site. In addition
    to managing the project, I've also written a large part of the backend.

[Guide]: https://guide.aelve.com

I have written perhaps the most popular [Aeson tutorial][] and I used to be
teaching people Haskell at [Haskell Learning Group][HLG]. I have given
several different talks on Haskell-related topics, and I plan to do more.
