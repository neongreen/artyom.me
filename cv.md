## What I do

_2017–now:_ founder of Aelve. I am managing [Aelve Guide][], a collaborative workspace for large research teams, and [Aelve Codesearch][], a regex-based code search engine.

_2017–now:_ co-founder of [Monadfix][], a functional programming consultancy.

_2018–2019:_ backend engineer at [Wire][]. The [backend][wire-server] is fully open-source and written in Haskell. I was involved with development, writing specs, doing prototyping for novel features, operations (Cassandra, AWS, Ansible, Kubernetes), and hiring.

_2016–2018:_ software engineer at [Serokell][]. I was one of core developers of [Cardano][], a hugely successful cryptocurrency with dozens of devs on the team. I was involved in many architectural and design decisions, and wrote a substantial part of the codebase.
