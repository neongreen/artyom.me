## Who I am

I'm a Haskeller with nine years of experience. I have spent substantial time
dealing with REST APIs (client and server), parsing, serialization, FFI,
GUIs, and implementing protocols. I have delivered talks about lenses,
Template Haskell, and type-level programming.

I used to be a cryptocurrency developer, and a backend engineer for an
end-to-end-encrypted messenger. Right now I'm focusing on my own projects,
including a software consultancy and a collaborative workspace for research
teams.

## What I do

Right now I'm working on [Aelve Guide][], improving state-of-the-art for
research collaboration.

I am also a co-founder of [Monadfix][], a functional programming
consultancy.

Previously I worked at [Wire][]. Our [backend][wire-server] is fully
open-source and written in Haskell. I was busy implementing enhancements,
writing specs, and doing prototyping for novel features, as well as some
devops work (Cassandra, AWS, Ansible, Kubernetes).

Even more previously I worked at [Serokell][], where I was one of core
developers of [Cardano][], a hugely successful cryptocurrency with dozens of
devs on the team. Other than writing a substantial part of the code and
doing bug-hunting, I was involved in many architectural and design
decisions.
