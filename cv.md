## About me

I'm a self-taught Haskeller with 1 year of professional experience (6 years overall). In the past I successfully participated in IOI and ACM-style programming competitions; if needed, I'd be able to refresh my knowledge of algorithms pretty quickly. Also, I enjoy writing tutorials (and documenting things in general).

I speak Russian and English.

## Potential dealbreakers

  * I dropped out of university after half a year
  * I've only been employed once, and unofficially
  * I have no experience with any kind of web apps (or mobile apps)
  * I don't really know any languages besides Haskell

## Haskell

I've been studying and using Haskell for 6 years.

My most used library is probably [microlens](@hackage), a minimal lens library compatible with [lens](@hackage). Speaking of lenses, I also wrote a [series of articles](http://artyom.me/#lens-over-tea) about the implementation of lens; as the Haskell wikibook [puts it](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Lenses_and_functional_references#Further_reading):

> \[Several paragraphs above,\] we said that lens easily provides enough material for a full book. The closest thing to that we currently have is Artyom Kazak's "lens over tea" series of blog posts. It explores the implementation of functional references in lens and the concepts behind it in far more depth than what we are able to do here. Highly recommended reading.

For a client, I wrote a backend for a static website hosting, a CLI tool for interacting with it, and parts of the server and [Liquid markup](http://liquidmarkup.org/) parser/renderer. For another client, I designed a [task](http://artyom.me/haskell-ctf) for a hacker competition.

I have several yet-unreleased projects; the ones that I'm working on right now are a [character search tool](@gh:aelve/bob) that finds Unicode characters by a vague ASCII approximation, and a [minimalistic reminding tool](@gh:aelve/tom).

Finally, I have written a pretty popular (and possibly the most comprehensive) [Aeson tutorial](http://artyom.me/aeson).

## Everything else

Several years ago I've been actively participating in IOI/ACM-style programming competitions:

  * Belarusian National Olympiad (2012): 15th place, silver
  * All-Russian Team Olympiad (2011): 10th place, bronze
  * Moscow Open Olympiad in Programming (2012): silver

I have basic knowledge of SQL, and Sqlite in particular (where “basic knowledge” means “enough to write a backend for a static website hosting”). I also know some C, Pascal, [Racket][], and [Nim][].
