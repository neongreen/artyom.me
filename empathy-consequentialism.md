% If justifications turn your empathy off, it's broken

Would you agree to experience some pain if you were paid for it and after it your memory was erased? (Assume no harm of any kind – only pain.)

To some people (like me some time ago) the solution is simple:

  * Initial state: you feel fine, you have 0$
  * State A: you feel fine, you have 10$
  * State B: you feel fine, you have 0$

A is clearly preferable to B, so you must choose to experience pain and have your memory erased (i.e. do what leads to A). Problem solved. Where is pain in this analysis? Well, nowhere, but that's the *beauty* of the argument – you can disregard intermediate steps and simplify the problem. Those who give different answers simply can't think rationally, they start *imagining* experiencing that pain and let emotions cloud their judgement, but if they were truly [consequentialist](http://raikoth.net/consequentialism.html) it wouldn't even occur to them because all they'd look at would be final states, *consequences*, and consequences of any act are the only things that matter when evaluating an act.

In fact, I'm pretty sure I used to state that I'd agree to experience any amount of pain for any money (even 1¢) any amount of times as long as this wasn't taking my time / interfering with my life otherwise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I also remember is why I held this position. It wasn't conceived as a way to get easy money – rather, it was a reaction to my dad's answer to the same question. To be more precise,

  * first I randomly asked my dad whether ne'd agree to experience pain for money if later it was erased from nir memory

  * then dad said “of course not”

  * and only then I decided that a) dad was stupid and didn't have any arguments against it, b) wasn't even a consequentialist, and c) but I wasn't like nem, and I would agree, because hey, easy money

This bit is important. I didn't randomly think “getting tortured could be a good way to make money, I wish somebody offered that deal to me”; I had to decide that in order to maintain consistency. In reality I *thought* that anybody who wouldn't agree was stupid, but I wasn't *wishing* “oh if only somebody would come and offer me this choice”.

Of course, I'm not saying there's a contradiction here; I'm only saying that if you would choose A over B but don't want to have to choose at all, it strongly suggests that A and B both aren't good. Getting tortured for 1¢ is bad because you're getting tortured; *refusing* to get tortured for 1¢ is bad because then you're not a consequentialist. (And never being offered the choice is very different from being offered the choice and stubbornly refusing to take the only sensible option because you're the kind of person who thinks with nir emotions and not with nir brain.)

The Last Psychiatrist [writes](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/03/when_is_it_okay_to_rape_a_woma.html) about the following question asked on some radio show by some intern:

> if you could rape a girl, but then give her this magic drug that left her with no memory of the rape, would you do it?

It's almost the same question as the previous one. If you think that actions don't matter but consequences do, you'd rape the girl; if you're thinking with your emotions (or, worse, the part of your brain that automatically screams “BAD” at anything that has “rape” in it), you wouldn't. What has changed – apart from “torture” being replaced with “rape” – is that now you're not the person being tortured.

> In responding to the intern, Ron (the host) made an obvious point, and before I make it I want you to clear your mind and imagine yourself acting out this scenario. You're a man, on top of the woman, finishing, pulling out, and then giving her the drug. She blinks, looks at you like she forgot what she was going to say, and goes back to ringing up your order.
>
> Got that image? She doesn't remember anything. She's perfectly happy, no harm done at all. The point Ron made was, “so if a couple of my boys from the west village rape you in the ass, and inject you with the drug, that's ok?” He used the word “fucking” to modify every noun in that sentence, but I'm paraphrasing.
>
> Some of you are right now experiencing a weird disconnection. Like the intern, that obvious thought simply *hadn't occurred to you*. And it wakes you up to the reality of the rape, *of course* this rape is wrong. Forcing you to imagine yourself as the victim makes the scenario more real, more vivid.

Oh, but it *had* occured to me, and what I had concluded wasn't “but I'd hate this to happen to me, so it's wrong!”. It was “yep, I'd be okay with it happening to me, and if I feel mildly displeased with the prospect that's because I'm not fully rational either – but *you*, you are so much less rational than me”.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The post makes a lot of tangentially related points about psychology that I don't agree with (or at least don't see enough evidence for). However, it also makes a pretty scary one (emphasis mine):

> The intern, and you, don't even need to have performed this rape; simply by answering the question in the affirmative, your lives have veered sharply to the left, you have made connecting with another person substantially more difficult. By which I mean impossible.

> The argument here is that you would rape her as long as she wouldn't remember it or suffer, *but it reveals how little you are able to perceive the complete existence of others that you would even consider using them as a prop.*

The thing is that so far we've only been talking about naive consequentialism. Non-naive consequentialism doesn't actually gives us the “rape is okay” answer here – if it did, it'd also make torturing -very old ladies living alone- justified:

  * Initial state: an old lady lives alone
  * State A: a week later, the old lady is dead (and you have tortured nem meanwhile)
  * State B: a week later, the old lady is dead (and you haven't done anything to nem)

In fact, it'd make *anything* justified:

  * Initial state: planet Earth
  * State A: heat death of the universe (and you did \<something\> [10^1000^][heat death] years ago)
  * State B: heat death of the universe (and you didn't do \<something\> 10^1000^ years ago)

[heat death]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_timeline_from_Big_Bang_to_Heat_Death

Okay, but if naive consequentialism fails so spectacularly, how could it feel like it works? To what kind of person could it occur as a possible solution?

And the answer is: to a person whose empathy can *turn off* in presence of a justification. It's not that you compared the costs and decided that the cost of an hour of torture is fairly small – no, you stopped taking torture into account once you were told that it won't be remembered; I told your brain “in this scenario, you can disregard torture”, and the brain complied.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see how it applies in more mundane scenarios than torture + amnesia.

You told me something scary, and then it turned out that it was a joke. Yes, I was scared for a while, but since it was temporary (you admitted that it was a joke in about half an hour), you don't feel guilty.

You told your sister that there are worms living in nir gut, and if if ne doesn't believe you ne can google it. Ne believed you, and was disgusted and sort of upset afterwards. You laughed at nem for being silly and so bothered about something that shouldn't bother nem.

Your child doesn't want to play violin, but it's alright, *ne'll thank you later*. Ne hates the summer camp so far, but ne'll start liking it after a while, so it's okay too.

Your boyfriend has social anxiety, but you keep pushing nem to talk to people more and you always remind nem that if ne keeps ordering pizza online (and not by phone) ne'll be stuck with nir fear of people forever. Ne doesn't seem to get it, which is really annoying.

“In this scenario, you can disregard”, your brain tell itself, and happily complies.

(Note that I'm not saying that everything that you're doing under the influence of “you'll thank me later” is wrong. I'm saying that with your empathy turned off, you have no way to know whether it's wrong or not, and most likely you won't even be bothered to find out.)
