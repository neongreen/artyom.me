% Lack of empathy disguised as naive consequentialism

Would you agree to experience some pain if you were paid for it and after it your memory was erased? (Assume no harm of any kind – only pain.)

To some people (like me some time ago) the solution is simple:

  * Initial state: you feel fine, you have 0$
  * State A: you feel fine, you have 10$
  * State B: you feel fine, you have 0$

A is clearly preferable to B, so you must choose to experience pain and have your memory erased (i.e. do what leads to A). Problem solved. Where is pain in this analysis? Well, nowhere, but that's the *beauty* of the argument – you can disregard intermediate steps and simplify the problem. Those who give different answers simply can't think rationally, they start *imagining* experiencing that pain and let emotions cloud their judgement, but if they were truly [consequentialist](http://raikoth.net/consequentialism.html) it wouldn't even occur to them because all they'd look at would be final states, *consequences*, and consequences of any act are the only things that matter when evaluating an act.

In fact, I'm pretty sure I used to state that I'd agree to experience any amount of pain for any money (even 1¢) any amount of times as long as this wasn't taking my time / interfering with my life otherwise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I also remember is why I held this position. It wasn't conceived as a way to get easy money – rather, it was a reaction to my dad's answer to the same question. To be more precise,

  * first I randomly asked my dad whether ne'd agree to experience pain for money if later it was erased from nir memory

  * then dad said “of course not”

  * and only then I decided that a) dad was stupid and didn't have any arguments against it, b) wasn't even a consequentialist, and c) but I wasn't like nem, and I would agree, because hey, easy money

This bit is important. I didn't randomly think “getting tortured could be a good way to make money, I wish somebody offered that deal to me”; I had to decide that in order to maintain consistency. In reality I *thought* that anybody who wouldn't agree was stupid, but I *wished* never to have to make the choice myself.

Of course, I'm not saying there's a contradiction here; I'm only saying that if you would choose A over B but wish you didn't have to choose at all, it strongly suggests that A and B are both bad. Getting tortured for 1¢ is bad because you're getting tortured; *refusing* to get tortured for 1¢ is bad because then you're not a consequentialist. (And never being offered the choice is very different from being offered the choice and stubbornly refusing to take the only sensible option because you're the kind of person who thinks with nir emotions and not with nir brain.)

The Last Psychiatrist [writes](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/03/when_is_it_okay_to_rape_a_woma.html) about the following question asked on some radio show by some intern:

> if you could rape a girl, but then give her this magic drug that left her with no memory of the rape, would you do it?

It's the same question really, just rephrased. If you think that actions don't matter but consequences do, you'd rape the girl; if you're thinking with your emotions (or, worse, the part of your brain that automatically screams “BAD” at anything that has “rape” in it), you wouldn't.

> In responding to the intern, Ron (the host) made an obvious point, and before I make it I want you to clear your mind and imagine yourself acting out this scenario. You're a man, on top of the woman, finishing, pulling out, and then giving her the drug. She blinks, looks at you like she forgot what she was going to say, and goes back to ringing up your order.
>
> Got that image? She doesn't remember anything. She's perfectly happy, no harm done at all. The point Ron made was, “so if a couple of my boys from the west village rape you in the ass, and inject you with the drug, that's ok?” He used the word “fucking” to modify every noun in that sentence, but I'm paraphrasing.
>
> Some of you are right now experiencing a weird disconnection. Like the intern, that obvious thought simply *hadn't occurred to you*. And it wakes you up to the reality of the rape, *of course* this rape is wrong. Forcing you to imagine yourself as the victim makes the scenario more real, more vivid.

Oh, but it *had* occured to me, and what I had concluded wasn't “but I'd hate this to happen to me, so it's wrong!”. It was “yep, I'd be okay with it happening to me, and if I feel mildly displeased with the prospect that's because I'm not fully rational either – but *you*, you are so much less rational than me”.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The post makes a lot of tangentially related points about psychology that I don't agree with (or at least don't see enough evidence for).

However, there's one point that is both true and scary:

> The intern, and you, don't even need to have performed this rape; simply by answering the question in the affirmative, your lives have veered sharply to the left, you have made connecting with another person substantially more difficult. By which I mean impossible.
>
> [...]
>
> The argument here is that you would rape her as long as she wouldn't remember it or suffer, but it reveals how little you are able to perceive the complete existence of others that you would even consider using them as a prop.

Consequentialism doesn't actually gives us the “rape is okay” answer here – if it did, it'd also make torturing old ladies living alone justified:

  * Initial state: an old lady lives alone
  * State A: 5 days later, the old lady is dead (and you have tortured nem meanwhile)
  * State B: 5 days later, the old lady is dead (and you haven't done anything to nem)

In fact, it'd make *anything* justified (which is why it's naive consequentialism):

  * Initial state: planet Earth
  * State A: heat death of the universe (and you did \<something\> [10^1000^][heat death] years ago)
  * State B: heat death of the universe (and you didn't do \<something\> 10^1000^ years ago)

[heat death]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_timeline_from_Big_Bang_to_Heat_Death

So, it's not consequentialism that makes me choose rape, it's lack of regard for suffering that makes me choose rape for others, and consequentialism simply forces me to be consistent and choose rape for myself as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

> You can imagine yourself getting raped by the West Village guys, and that's really vividly bad. Imagining what she must feel when you do it to her – that's really *vaguely* good. How easy is it to empathize? Easy. How easy is it to sympathize? Not so easy.

For me sympathising isn't easy, empathising isn't easy, and even empathising to myself (i.e. imagining things) isn't easy – in order to get an emotional reaction from myself I have to substitute “getting raped by the West Village guys” with “getting my testicles crushed with a press and then magically restored”.

What did ne say about not being able to connect to people again?

Oh fuck.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can actually connect to people, sometimes; however, the pseudo-consequentialist position still manifests itself. Simplest example: “my SO is anxious about writing an email to \<someone\>, but since it'll be good for nem to have it written, I'll force nem to do it, and anxiety doesn't matter because there won't be anxiety after the fact”. Multiplied by the amount of times anxiety happens, this looks like a lot of anxiety. Is it worth it? Maybe, maybe not, who knows. The point isn't that it's not worth it, the point is that without working empathy *you can't really know*. The fake-consequentialism model doesn't weigh anxiety against benefits from fighting it, it disregards anxiety altogether, and we end up with: harder, better, faster, stronger, don't go to sleep late, don't waste time on Reddit, do something useful, shut up your emotions, make the right decision, donate to charity instead of buying this useless thing, force yourself thru pain and thru boredom and thru anxiety and thru disgust and thru indifference, this all is good for you, you know that, right? *In the end you'll thank me.*

And if the person doesn't thank you, well, that's nir fault, ne either wasn't a consequentialist or didn't have enough courage to apply consequentialism to nemself. You just have to find somebody else, somebody who would be braver, who would appreciate you pushing nem and not letting nem become a loser that ne would undoubtedly become without your help.

Right?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One last thing:

“Okay, I learned my lesson. I'll be pushing other people less – just enough to be making their lives better, but not enough for them to start detesting me or break down.”

No. If you had empathy you wouldn't have to regulate pushing in the 1st place; pushing too much is only a symptom. Deal with empathy and it's possible that you'll have to *start* pushing more often than you would've otherwise; don't deal with empathy and you'll keep having to restrain yourself from pushing, forever. Which would mean, by the way, either distancing yourself from the other person (so that you wouldn't have to make the painful choice between pushing and not pushing every time), or continuing to make the choice over and over until you become tired enough – and then you'll quit. No matter what you do, the prophecy about not being able to connect with the other person will be fulfilled.
